# Forgery

A hopefully 1:1 replacement for the veteran Hammer World Editor by Valve Corporation.

Currently supporting viewing vmfs in 3d with both a wireframe and textured views (2D in the works but not quite there yet).

A large amount of the code here is from Galaco's work on [Lambda](https://github.com/Galaco/Lambda) & [Lambda-Client](https://github.com/Galaco/Lambda-Client). 


## Screenshots
Colors are currently wrong due to how imgui's shader renders drawlist data.
